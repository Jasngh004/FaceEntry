#### FaceEntry Description

FaceEntry is a secure entrance system utilizing digital image processing through live video
screenings specifically designed for movie theaters, employing facial recognition technology. The
primary aim of FaceEntry is to elevate the ticket booking and entry process within movie theaters
by integrating a secure and efficient facial recognition system for entry. Instead of relying on
traditional paper or e-tickets and enduring long queues at the entrance for physical ticket checks,
we leverage digital image processing to identify faces from the live screening video at the entrance
gate, thereby streamlining and securing the process.
FaceEntry is designed to accommodate queue-based crowd gatherings. Upon joining the queue,
the screening camera will stream live video footage displayed on the designated monitor. It will
capture the current facial frame, compare it with the database, and then either grant or deny
access based on the match!
In this way, FaceEntry will allow an efficient and secure entrance system for movie theaters
